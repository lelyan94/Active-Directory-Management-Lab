#üñß AD Network Lab Simulation

# Introduction
This project demonstrates a basic Active Directory and DHCP network lab using VMware Workstation. The lab includes Windows Server, Linux DHCP server, and two Windows clients, simulating a functional domain environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- VMware Workstation
- Windows Server
- Ubuntu Server (DHCP)
- Windows 10 Clients

## üìÅ Project Structure
- `Windows Server`: AD, DNS, NAT, and RRAS configuration
- `Linux DHCP Server`: Static IP setup, DHCP service, internet access
- `Windows Clients`: Domain joining, IP assignment, connectivity tests

## üîß VMware Workstation
