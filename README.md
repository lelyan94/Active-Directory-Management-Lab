#üñß AD Network Lab Simulation

# Introduction
This project demonstrates a basic Active Directory and DHCP network lab using VMware Workstation. The lab includes Windows Server, Linux DHCP server, and two Windows clients, simulating a functional domain environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- VMware Workstation
- Windows Server
- Ubuntu Server (DHCP)
- Windows 10 Clients

## üìÅ Project Structure
- `Windows Server`: AD, DNS, NAT, and RRAS configuration
- `Linux DHCP Server`: Static IP setup, DHCP service, internet access
- `Windows Clients`: Domain joining, IP assignment, connectivity tests

## üîß VMware Workstation

### ‚û§ VMware Workstation ‚Äì Network Topology

This screenshot displays the full network setup in VMware Workstation. It shows all four virtual machines: Windows Server, Linux DHCP server, and two Windows Clients. It also highlights the network adapter configuration for each VM, simulating an internal network with NAT and DHCP.

ü™ü Windows Server
‚û§ Active Directory ‚Äì Users and Computers
The Windows Server is configured as a domain controller. This screenshot shows the Active Directory Users and Computers interface, where:

- Two Windows clients have been successfully joined to the domain.

- Five domain user accounts have been created.

‚û§ DNS ‚Äì Forward Lookup Zones
The DNS service is installed on the Windows Server. This screenshot shows the Forward Lookup Zones, which include host (A) records for internal machines. This allows domain name resolution within the local network.

‚û§ RRAS ‚Äì NAT Configuration
This screenshot shows the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) setup. The Windows Server is configured to act as a NAT gateway, allowing internal machines (clients and Linux server) to access the internet through the server‚Äôs external NIC.

‚û§ IP Configuration of Windows Server
This screenshot shows the result of the ipconfig /all command on the Windows Server. It confirms the static IP address, DNS settings, gateway configuration, and domain details for the server.

üêß Linux DHCP Server
‚û§ Static IP and Host Settings
This screenshot combines outputs from:

- ip add
- ip route
- hostname
- cat /etc/resolv.conf

It confirms that the Linux server is using a static IP address and is properly configured as a DHCP server in the local network.

‚û§ Internet Connectivity from Linux Server
This screenshot demonstrates that the Linux DHCP server can access the internet (likely through the NAT configured on the Windows Server). The connection is verified via a successful ping or a browser check.

‚û§ DHCP Scope Configuration
This image shows the configuration of the DHCP service on the Linux server, including the defined IP address range (scope) used to assign IPs to Windows clients dynamically.

üíª Windows Client 1
‚û§ IP Configuration and DHCP Lease
This ipconfig /all output shows that Windows Client 1 received its IP address from the Linux DHCP server. It also confirms the assigned domain name and DNS server used.

‚û§ Hostname Resolution with Ping
This screenshot shows the results of ping commands to both the Windows Server and another Windows Client using hostnames (not IP addresses). It confirms DNS is working correctly in the domain.
